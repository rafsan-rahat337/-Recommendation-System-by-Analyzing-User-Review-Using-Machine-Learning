# Recommendation System by Analyzing User Reviews Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a hybrid machine learning–based recommendation system that analyzes user-generated reviews to provide accurate and personalized product recommendations. The system combines collaborative filtering and dimensionality reduction techniques to improve prediction accuracy and scalability on large real-world datasets.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Hybrid recommendation framework
- Collaborative filtering using:
  - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  - KNNWithMeans
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Evaluation using standard performance metrics:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- Designed for large-scale, real-world datasets

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning of user reviews and ratings  
2. Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction using PCA  
3. Model implementation using SVD, KNN, and KNNWithMeans  
4. Hybrid model evaluation and comparison  
5. Performance analysis using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE
